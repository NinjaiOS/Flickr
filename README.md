## Technical Challenge

Create an image gallery app that uses Flickrâ€™s public feed (and its relevant filters) as a data source. Wireframes are provided as a guide for what your app should look like.
You can find detailed information about the API on https://www.flickr.com/services/api/


## Mandatory Requirements

- [x] Use the latest development tools for the platform you are working on
- [x] You may use third party libraries
- [x] Use a software version control system
- [x] Fetch data from the web
- [x] Metadata must be visible for each image


## Optional Requirements

- Image Caching
-  Share image
- Open image in browser
- Save Image
- Order image by date
- Unit Tests


## Evaluation

You do not need to provide a fully functional app, we will evaluate your effort by your approach to development and following parameters.

- Code Readability vs. Complexity
- Architecture
- Project Structure
- Software Version Control Usage
- Software Design Principles
- API usage


## Output

Provide a link or access to your public version control repository. (i.e. Github, Bitbucket etc.)
